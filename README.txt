Code package for DeltaCalibration. 

DeltaCalibration calculates delta-transforms given input bagfiles of kinect depth image data. The output pose files can be fed to the included matlab files to generate extrinsic calibration for input sensors. check_transform can then be used to visualize the quality of a transform between two sensors using the output transform file from the matlab scripts. find_z is used to identify the z-axis translation for a turtlebot sensor given the partial transform calculated by the turtlebot_cal matlab script. visualize_poses can be used to visualize the transform for a turtlebot base and a kinect sensor.
